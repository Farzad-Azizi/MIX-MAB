# MIX-MAB

This is a framework that we customized for simulation the distributed learning-base resource allocations in LoRa (Long-Range) Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). The most Sutible candidate for IoT networks.\ We then simulate our proposed solution called "MIX-MAB" in it.
For more details U can read the related paper: "A Reinforcement Learning-based Resource Allocation Algorithm For Improve The Throuput of LoRaWAN"
You can also involved in our project or made any changes if U want :)
