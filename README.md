# MIX-MAB

This is a framework that we deployed for simulation the distributed learning-base resource allocations in LoRa (Long-Range) Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). The most Sutible candidate for IoT network.\ We then simulate our proposed solution called "MIX-MAB" in it.
For more details please read the related paper named "A Reinforcement Learning-based Resource Allocation Algorithm for Throuput Improvement of LoRaWAN"
You can also involved in our project or made any changes if U want :)
